This directory contains the files needed to make NPSOL.  The source
code for NPSOL is not distributed with NTG, so you will need to obtain
that separately.  Information on NPSOL is available at

    http://www.sbsi-sol-optimize.com/NPSOL.htm

INSTALLATION
------------
To install NPSOL, you must first get the original source code files
(see URL above).  The following files are required for NTG:

    blas1.f, blas2.f, chsubs.f, cmsubs.f, f06subs.f, lssolsubs.f,
    mcsubs.f, npsolsubs.f, opsubs.f, qrsubs.f, srsubs.f

Note that in the standard NPSOL distribution, these files have ".for"
as the suffix, so you will need to rename them.  Once these files are
installed in the npsol/ directory, perform the following steps to
install NPSOL:

  1. Edit Makefile and make sure everything is pointed where you want
  2. Type 'make" to make the NPSOL library, libnpsol.a
  3. If everything works, type 'make install' to install the library

To test the installation, you can copy npmain.f and npsol.opt from the NPSOL
distribution to this directory, run 'make test' and then run 'npmain' to
verify proper operation (you should find an optimimum value).

If you don't have f77 installed, you can probably use gfortran, using
the following command:

  make -F77=gfortran
